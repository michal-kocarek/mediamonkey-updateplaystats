# Update Play Statistics – MediaMonkey plugin

> Update Play Statistics is plugin for [MediaMonkey](http://www.mediamonkey.com/) 
> which allows you to **manually update play statistics for tracks** in your library. 
> You can manually adjust Play Count or Last Play date for selected tracks. 

### Download & Install

### Building

The `Build/build.js` script packs everything into MMIP file. See its contents for more info how to execute.

### Hacking code

This is one of few MediaMonkey plugins written in JScript. I hate VBScript
and that’s why had chosen the second scripting language. However this should not cause any problems 
as MM is compatible with both of them.
